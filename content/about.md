Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;

你们和我都已老了，但老年

Death closes all: but something ere the end,

仍有老年的荣誉、老年的辛劳；

Some work of noble note, may yet be done,

死亡终结一切，但在终点前

Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.

我们还能做一番崇高的事业，使我们配称为与神斗争的人。

The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:

礁石上的灯标开始闪光了：

The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep

长昼将尽，月亮缓缓攀登，

Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,

大海用无数音响在周围呻唤。来呀，朋友们，探寻更新的世界

‘Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

现在尚不是为时过晚。

Push off, and sitting well in order smite

开船吧！坐成排，划破这喧哗的海浪，

The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds

我决心驶向

To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

太阳沉没的彼方，超越

Of all the western stars, until I die.

西方星斗的浴场，至死方止。

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

也许深渊会把我们吞噬，

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

也许我们将到达琼岛乐土，

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

与老朋友阿喀琉斯会晤。

Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’

尽管已达到的多，未知的也多啊，

We are not now that strength which in old days

虽然我们的力量已不如当初，

Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;

已远非昔日移天动地的雄姿，

One equal temper of heroic hearts,

但我们仍是我们，英雄的心

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

尽管被时间消磨，被命运削弱，

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

奋斗、探索、寻求，而不屈服。
